-- TELL --

tell <username> <message>

This command sends <message> to <username>.  Trying to think of 
what else I can tell you about the "tell" command.  There's not 
too much too it.  That's really about it.  Let's not make things
more complicated than they need to be, okay?   Maybe I'll get 
all fancy and let you tell a group of people something one day, but
for now, it's just "tell <user> <message>"
