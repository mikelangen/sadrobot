tell <username> <message>

This command sends <message> to <username>.  Trying to think of 
what else I can tell you about the "tell" command.  There's not 
too much to it.  That's really about it.  Let's not make things
more complicated than they need to be, okay?   Maybe I'll get 
all fancy and let you tell a group of people something one day, but
for now, it's just "tell <user> <message>"

Nope, there's nothing fancy or special about this
command.  It just does exactly what you would 
expect it to do.  It disconnects you from the server.
